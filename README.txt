We delve into the evaluation of local smoothing methods, including LOESS, 
Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing, and spline smoothing. Our goal is to analyze their 
performance in estimating the Mexican hat function under different design scenarios. 
Specifically, we simulate datasets based on the additive noise model, considering equidistant and 
non-equidistant points, and assess the efficacy of these methods in capturing the underlying 
patterns. The challenges faced during these estimations, both statistical and computational, are 
thoroughly examined.
